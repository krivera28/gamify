(a) Summary of presentation introduction: 
- Gamifying is the process of treating your life like a video game. Often, it is difficult to complete daily tasks, especially if they are cumbersome or mundane. However, Gamify makes them fun to complete as you are able to quantify the progress that you make! With this project, we want to help people organize their life better by giving them the framework to gamify their life.
- Functionality: a website where users can “Gamify” their life by saving their tasks and seeing the progress they make
- Improvements: programs like this exist, but the most commonly used ones are spreadsheet format, which can be overwhelming because users are presented with so much information at once, so we wanted to streamline the process
