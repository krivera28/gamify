      <h2>What does Gamify mean?</h2>
      <p>Gamifying is the process of treating your life like a video game.</p>
      <p>Often, it is difficult to complete daily tasks, especially if they are cumbersome or mundane. However, Gamify makes them fun to complete as you are able to quantify the progress that you make!</p>
